# Career Exploration Program - Software Engineer

Welcome to the application for the CEP Software Engineer track! In this app, you'll create a simple "About Me" app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

To complete the application and submit it, follow the instructions below.

_The commands and keyboard shortcuts are for Mac users. They may not be accurate for Windows users._

### Creating your Github account

To get started, go to [Github.com](www.github.com) and sign up for an account. If you're unfamiliar with Github, it may be worthwhile to checkout this short [article](https://www.howtogeek.com/180167/htg-explains-what-is-github-and-what-do-geeks-use-it-for/) to familiarize yourself with some of the terminology.

This is where you will store your finished application. When you're doing with the project, you will submit the link to your repo.

### Downloading an editor

You'll need a code editor in order to complete the project. There are many out there - Sublime, Atom, etc. If you have a preference, feel free to use it. If not, [Atom](https://atom.io/) is a good choice. Choose your favorite and download it.

### Cloning the repo

You will need to clone this [repo](https://github.com/kjhandy/cep-engr-app).

1. Open up your terminal. You can do this with command + space bar and then type in 'terminal'.
2. You can find out the location of your current working directory by typing in `pwd`.
3. Let's create a new directory to store your coding projects in. Type in `mkdir Projects`.
4. Type in `ls` and you will see that a new directory called 'Projects' was created.
5. Switch into that directory by typing in `cd Projects`.
6. If you type in `ls` again, you'll notice that the folder is empty.
7. Let's add our first repo to the Projects directory. Navigate to the [repo](https://github.com/kjhandy/cep-engr-app).
8. In the top right corner, click on the button that says "Fork" and then select your github.
9. Click on the green button that says "Clone or download" and copy the link.
10. On the command line, type in `git clone INSERT LINK` replacing the `INSERT LINK` with the link you just copied.
8. Once it's downloaded, if you type in `ls` again, you'll notice that your project was added to the directory.
9. Navigate into that project by typing `cd cep-engr-app`.
10. Open up the project with your editor.

## Instructions

 For an example project, check out example.gif in the root directory.

 All of your files are in the `src` directory. You'll see that you have one file for HTML, one for CSS, and one for JavaScript. You also have an `img` directory to store any images that you use.

 Here are the mandatory guidelines:

 - Include a header with an image as the background
 - Include an `h1` with a title for your website
 - Include an image. It can be anything -- a headshot, a picture of your favorite memory, a picture of your last trip, etc.
 - Include 5 buttons - First Name, Last Name, Job Title, Home Office, and Tell Me More
 - Create a JavaScript object in the `init.js` file with the following fields: firstName, lastName, jobTitle, homeOffice, tellMeMore
 - Using jQuery, as the user clicks on the button, reveal the appropriate information using the values from the JS object

 Feel free to take creative license however you want! The point of the exercise is to get a sense that you know the basics of HTML, CSS, and JS, but your page does not need to look like the example.

## Finishing up

 Once you've completed the above instructions, you'll need to push up your work to your repo!

 - On the command line, type in `git status`. You'll see all of the files that you have created or changed.
 - Type in `git add .` to add all of those files to your commit.
 - Type in `git commit -m "MESSAGE"` replacing `MESSAGE` with your commit message.
 - Type in `git push origin master` to push up all of your work.
